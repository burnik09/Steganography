# Steganography

This project is about hiding images or text inside images. The practice of steganography allows users to hide data inside images, audio or text files so noone can see them. This helps with security espetially when combined with cryptography

## Features

- Adding photo paths manually
- The option of hiding text **or** an image inside another image
- The option to decrypt the message or to stay secretive

## Usage

- First of all you need to choose if you want to hide an image or text inside another image
- Then you get to choose the file path
  - The first image is the one that is displayed the second image is the hidden one
  - In the case you chose to hide text you enter only one file path and the next input should be the secret message
- After you encode the image then you have an option to decode it and if you press yes:
  - If you chose to hide an image both of the images get displayed
  - Else the secret message gets displayed
- Just a heads up for now you can only add PNG files
- Reccomendation: If you want to encrypt images try to make the images a similar size because you will get much better results like that
